I'm Jos√© Alexandre Pereira. 
I'm from Barreiro. 
I'm currently doing the Data Analytics Bootcamp.
I have no previous experience with technology or data.
I'm a carreer changer.
I came to IronHack because I belive it will give me the knowledge needed to start a carrer and find a job that will let me relate data with Nature. And in some kind of way improve the life of every being on earth.
I expect to be able to predict future outcomes, find better and more efficient ways to improve our liftyle with proff that it will really help us in some way.
I hope to get a job as data analyst in some company taht will let me keep growing and aquire new skills, so that one day I can use all the learning in something meaningful.
Any industry that will chalenge me every single day into becoming a better Data Analyst, and if possible give me a possibility to keep learning about life.
I want to somewhere in the future be a person who others can rely on. I want to inspire people who love life and want to make life better for other.
My carrer goal for the nearest future is to work with Bilogical Data or just Data and sharpen my skills after the bootcamp, and after that be able to work with Artificial Inteligence.
